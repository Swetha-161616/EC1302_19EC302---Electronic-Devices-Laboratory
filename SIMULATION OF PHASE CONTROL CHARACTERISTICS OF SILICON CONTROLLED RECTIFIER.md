# SIMULATION OF PHASE CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS OF SILICON CONTROLLED RECTIFIER


## AIM:
To design and simulate the phase control characteristics of SCR circuit using LT-Spice.

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
1.Double click on LT-Spice icon.

2.New schematic window open.

3.Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram.

4.Complete the connections.

5.Add the thyristr.lib file using spice directive.

6.Right click on the voltage1 soruce and modify the values as SINE(0 10 50) and votage2 source modify the value as PULSE(0 5 3m 1n 1n 2m 20m).

6.Save the file by giving file name.

7.Click on the run option --> click advanced open --> select TRAN analysis --> enter the  stop time value.

8.Click on the run option --> simulation window opens --> place the probe --> output graph is obtained.
